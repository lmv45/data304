## 

I did two different types of interactions that we haven't learned in class. (<https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/interactions.html>)

1.  I did an interaction with the key to only highlight the section I clicked with just a one way axis
2.  I did an interaction with the key to only highlight the section I clicked with both an x and a y axis.

I used this source (<https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-basics.html#color-to-represent-data-values>) to help me determine what color theme I wanted to use for my graph in problem 4. Although, I couldn't code it to work I knew I wanted to use a sequential color scale.

I used this source (<https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/time-series.html>) to help decide if I wanted to use lines, dots or both for my graph in problem 3. I determined the dots weren't necessary to show the overall trend, so I removed them from my initial graph I made.
